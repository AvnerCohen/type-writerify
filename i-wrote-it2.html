<p>
The aim of our venture is to establish a new way of reading - and writing - books. We seek
to create a new way of consuming and appreciating literature.</p>
<p>To put it simply: we look for authors who are willing to write their next book in complete
transparency. That is, to allow the world a peek at their computer screen from the minute
they put their first word, their first letter, on the blank "Word" page, following every step
they make, every hesitation, every change and every typo, to the last word.</p>
<p>The online readers could follow the writer's work in real time or later on, by using
a "Playback" function at regular speed or with fast forward. Every move in the writing
process would be recorded and could be reconstructed for the site's subscribers. This way
they could, for the first time, follow the dynamics of the writing process of their favorite
authors and have an intimate, unprecedented look, into their creativity.</p>
<p>The readers/viewers/followers would pay for this experience at the same price they would
pay for the printed edition of the book. At the end of the process they would receive, in
addition to access to the site, either a printed copy or an e-version of the book, according to
their preference. The site would stay open long after the book is written so that new curious
subscribers could recover the writing process of a favorite work they've just read. This "Black
Box" could be sold separately or with the e-book itself, very much as the "Director's version"
or the "Making of" is added to many DVD's.</p>
<p>We believe that even an established writer would greatly benefit from this opportunity.
It will be a revolutionary event in both literature and on the internet, commanding the
attention of a wider audience.</p>
<p>Equally as important, the participating writer will be able to create a new, intimate and
sincere dialog with the readers without sacrificing his or her privacy. It is a pure literary
experience we are offering: letting the book sell itself: the writing - not the writer.</p>
<p>On a practical level, it is a means of selling books directly, on a significant scale, and in
advance. No need for cash advances from publishing houses. All the writers have to do in
order to achieve this, is to write their books as they would normally do.</p>
<p>The participating writer would have to consider both the opportunities and the challenges:
Opportunities, since a dynamic on-line book opens endless Borgesian forking paths for the
resourceful author; Challenges, since not everyone could stand this attention at the early
stages of their work.</p>
