<center style="font-size:15px;font-weight:bold;">In Their Heads</center>
<p>
The aim of our venture is to establish a new way of reading - and writing - literature. The means to achieve it is by creating a new way for buying books.</p>
<p>To put it simple: we look for authors who are willing to write their next book in complete transparency. That is, to allow the world a peek at their computer screen from the minute they put their first word, their first letter, on the blank "Word" page, following every step they make, every hesitation, every change and every typo, to the last word.</p>
<p>The online readers would be able to follow the writer's work either at real time or later on, by using a "Playback" function. Every move in the writing process would be recorded and could be reconstructed for the site's subscribers. This way they could, for the first time, follow the dynamic writing process of their favorite authors and have an intimate, unprecedented look, into their creative head. 
<p>All the readers/viewers/followers would have to pay for this experience  the same price they would pay for the printed edition of the book otherwise. At the end of the process they would receive, in addition to the access to the site, either a printed copy or an e-version of the book, according to their preference. The site would of course stay open long after the book was written so that new curious subscribers would  be able to recover the writing process of a favorite work they already read. This "Black Box" could even be sold separately or with the e-book itself, very much the same way a "Director's version" or "The Making of" are added today to many DVDs.</p>
<p>We believe even a good writer could benefit from this opportunity greatly.
<p>First, it is going to be a major, revolutionary, event both in literacy and in the internet sphere. The public attention for the first books written in such way cannot be underestimated.</p>
<p>More important, such a writer will be able to create a new intimate and sincere dialog with the readers without sacrificing his or her privacy. It is a pure literary experience we are offering: letting the book sell itself. The writing - not the writer.</p>
<p>On the very practical level, it is a way of selling books directly, on a huge scale, and in advance. No need for cash advances from publishing houses. For the work the authors would have done in any case (since there is no way writing a book without writing it...), they would get so much more and so much faster.</p>
<p>Each writer would have to consider of course both the opportunities and the challenges. Opportunities, since a dynamic on-line book opens endless Borgesian forking paths for the resourceful author. Challenges, since not everyone could stand so much attention at the early stages of their work.</p>
<p>The technical part of the project is simple and easy. What we need right now is the first major author.</p>
