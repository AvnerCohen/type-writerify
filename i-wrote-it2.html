<p>
The aim of our venture is to establish a new way of reading - and writing - literature.</p>
<p>To put it simply: we look for authors who are willing to write their next book in complete transparency. That is, to allow the world a peek at their computer screen from the minute they put their first word, their first letter, on the blank "Word" document, following every step they make, every hesitation, every change and every typo, to the last word.</p>
<p>The online readers could follow the writer's work either in real time or later on, by using a "Playback" function. Every move in the writing process would be recorded and could be reconstructed at any time and any speed for the site's subscribers. This way they could, for the first time, follow the dynamics of the writing process of their favorite authors and have an intimate, unprecedented look, into their creative mind.</p>
<p>The readers/viewers/followers would pay for this experience the same price they would pay for the printed edition of the book. At the end of the process they would receive, in addition to access to the site, either a printed copy or an e-version of the book, according to their preference. The site would stay open long after the book is written so that new curious subscribers could retrace the writing process of a favorite work they have just read. This "Black Box" could even be sold separately or with the e-book itself, very much as the "Director's version" or the "Making of" are added today to many DVD's.</p>
<p>We believe even a well renowned writer would greatly benefit from this opportunity, since it will be a major, revolutionary, event - both literary and in the internet sphere - and will attract the attention of a wider audience. </p>
<p>More important, the participating writer will be able to create a new intimate and sincere dialog with the readers without sacrificing his or her privacy. It is a pure literary experience we are offering: letting the book sell itself. The writing - not the writer.</p>
<p>On the practical level, it is a way of selling books directly, on a huge scale, and in advance. No need for cash advances from publishing houses. The writers are not required to do nothing but what they are needed anyway (since there is no way to write a book without writing it...).</p>

<p>The participating writer would have to consider both the opportunities and the challenges. Opportunities, since a dynamic on-line book opens endless Borgesian forking paths for the resourceful author. Challenges, since not everyone could stand attention at the early stages of their work.</p>
<p>The technical part of the project is simple and easy. What we need right now is the first major author.</p>
